## What is Babad Tanah Jawi?
  
Babad Tanah Jawi (Javanese: ê¦§ê¦§ê¦¢ê§ê¦ ê¦¤ê¦ê¦ê¦®ê¦¶, meaning "History of the Land of Java") is a generic title for many manuscripts written in Javanese language. Their arrangements and details vary, and no copies of any of the manuscripts are older than the 18th century.
  
According to Wikipedia[^1^], Babad Tanah Jawi is one of a number of accounts of Indonesian legends that scholars use to help illuminate aspects of the spread of Islam in Indonesia, the dominant religion in the Indonesian archipelago since the 16th century.
  
The texts attribute the first Javanese conversions to Islam to the Wali Sanga ("nine saints"), although their names and relationships vary across the texts to the extent that perfect reduction and agreement between them is not possible. Some of these names are Sunan Ngampel-Denta, Sunan Kudus, Sunan Murya, Sunan Bonang, Sunan Giri, Sunan Kalijaga, Sunan Sitijenar, Sunan Gunungjati, and Sunan Walilanang.
  
## What are the contents of Babad Tanah Jawi?
  
Babad Tanah Jawi covers the history of Java from the ancient times to the Islamic Mataram era. It also includes the genealogy of the Javanese kings, tracing their origins to Prophet Adam and other prophets.
  
According to Kompas.com[^3^], Babad Tanah Jawi can be divided into two main groups: First, Babad Tanah Jawi that was written by Carik Tumenggung Tirtowiguno (Carik Braja) by order of Pakubuwana III. This version was circulated in 1788. Second, Babad Tanah Jawi that was written by Carik Adilangu II who lived during Pakubuwana I and Pakubuwana II. The oldest manuscript dates back to 1722.
  
The difference between them lies in the narration of the history of ancient Java before the emergence of Mataram kingdom. The first group only tells briefly about Mataram's history, consisting of genealogy with little explanation, while the second group is equipped with long stories.
  
## How reliable is Babad Tanah Jawi?
  
Babad Tanah Jawi has attracted the attention of many historians. However, they also acknowledge its limitations and biases. For example, H.J. de Graaf said that what is written in Babad Tanah Jawi can be trusted, especially for historical events in the 16th to 18th centuries. But for history outside that era, de Graaf did not consider it as historical data because it was mixed with mythology, cosmology, and folklore.
  
Therefore, Babad Tanah Jawi should be used with critical and comparative approaches. It should not be taken as a primary source for historical research. It should be seen as a literary work that reflects the worldview and values of its authors and audiences
